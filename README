NAME

    Full - simplify common boilerplate for Perl scripts and modules

SYNOPSIS

     # in your script
     use Full::Script;
     # use strict, warnings, utf8 etc. are all now applied and in scope
     # or in a module that provides a class:
     use Full::Class;
     field $example;
     method example_method { return $example }

DESCRIPTION

    Perl has many modules and features, including some features which are
    somewhat discouraged in recent code.

    This module attempts to provide a good set of functionality for writing
    code without too many lines of boilerplate. It has been extracted from
    Myriad::Class so that it can be used in other code without pulling in
    too many irrelevant dependencies.

    For a list of Perl language features and modules applied by this,
    please see:

      * Full::Pragmata - base list

      * Full::Class - OO classes

      * Full::Script - .pl scripts

SEE ALSO

    There are many modules which provide similar functionality. Here are a
    few examples, in no particular order:

      * Modern::Perl

      * common::sense
